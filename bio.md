## Hey! Thanks for stopping by

My name is Isabelle Rathbun. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as a 2024 NDSEG fellow. I am co-advised by [Dr. Chris Metzler](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/metzler) and [Dr. Bill Regli](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/902/William-Regli). My current research focuses on Generative AI and increasing the robustness of multimodal, multi-sensor systems. I completed my undergrad in 2023 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I studied Computer Science, Math, and Biology.
